An efficient implementation of the Graph data structure in C++ with basic pathfinding (and other graph-based) algorithms.

This project also implements tentative support for real-world pathfinding using the 
resources provided by Dr. James D. Teresco's [Map-based Educational Tools for Algorithm Learning.](http://courses.teresco.org/metal/)
